# UNICEF Data and Analytics P3 Technical Evaluation

## Overview

This repository contains the solutions for the UNICEF Data and Analytics P3 Technical Evaluation. The tasks are designed to showcase the ability to perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, as well as to present findings in a clear and concise manner.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

  - `task_1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for Task 1, calculating population-weighted coverage of health services.
  - `task_2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for Task 2, analyzing the evolution of education for 4- to 5-year-old children in Zimbabwe.

## Task Descriptions

### Task 1: Population-Weighted Coverage of Health Services

The goal of Task 1 is to calculate the population-weighted coverage of antenatal care (ANC4) and skilled birth attendance (SAB) for countries categorized as on-track or off-track in achieving under-5 mortality targets as of 2023.

**Steps:**
1. Data preparation: Clean and merge the datasets based on common identifiers.
2. Calculate the population-weighted coverage for on-track and off-track countries using the provided formula.
3. Create a visualization comparing the population-weighted coverage estimates.

**Output:**
- A PNG image visualizing the comparison between on-track and off-track countries for each indicator.

### Task 2: Data Perspective on Education for 4- to 5-Year-Old Children

In Task 2, a Data Perspective was created to analyze the evolution of education for 4- to 5-year-old children, focusing on general education and specific subjects such as literacy, math, and physical education.

**Steps:**
1. Data cleaning and preparation of the MICS6 survey data from Zimbabwe.
2. Analyzing and visualizing the performance of children in various educational and developmental areas.
3. Writing a concise report (Data Perspective) summarizing the findings.

**Output:**
- A PDF report titled "Data Perspective on the Evolution of Education for Children under 5 in Zimbabwe".
